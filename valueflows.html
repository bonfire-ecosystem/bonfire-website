        <h2>Your plug & play federated social network</h2>
        <p>Bonfire aims to expand your freedom as a user of social networks, puts your data in your own hands
          (literally) and connects you with the people and communities you care about.

      <h4>Bonfire use case: social + economic networks</h4>

            <div class="description__content text">

      <p>
        Bonfire implements the social networking vocabulary <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/">Activity Streams</a> and also the economic networking
        vocabulary <a href="https://valueflo.ws/">ValueFlows</a>. 
      </p>You can publish and discuss their economic needs and offers and make decisions about them (as well as proposals, agreements, among other economic activities) with the same networks and apps you use for social networking. You can also decide to work together and then coordinate your work. And even define and calculate how to distribute value with all contributors. 
      </p>
      <p>It makes sense to have all of that in the same place, especially if the tools and infrastructure are set up and managed by you or someone you trust. <a href="/">Bonfire</a> is working to provide such tools. And because Bonfire
        networks can be federated using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> protocol, you
        can interact both socially and economically with any other people and groups using compatible software, which as of now means millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>The diagram below mentions some groups that are planning to use Bonfire for their combined social + economic
        networks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://disco.coop/manifesto/">DisCOs</a>: distributed cooperative organizations,</li>
        <li><a href="https://reflowproject.eu/">Reflow</a>: creating circular resource flows in European cities,</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mutualaidnetwork.org/">Mutual Aid Networks</a>, which are popping up all over the
          world,</li>
        <li>And maybe cooperatives federating economically with other co-ops. Some co-ops are now federating socially in places like
          <a href="https://social.coop/">Social.coop</a> using the same ActivityPub protocol, and are talking
          about federating economically. </li> 
      </ul>
